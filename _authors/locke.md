Locke is of average height with a wiry build. He wears a blue vest and trousers with a white shirt, although in concept art his outer clothes are black. He has light brown hair and wears a bandanna that is blue in-game and rolled into a headband; in the Yoshitaka Amano artwork it covers his hair and is more colorful and patterned. His outfit is belted with a short sash. He wears brown gloves in-game and in some concept art. In Dissidia Final Fantasy NT his outfit from his concept art is his main outfit and his game sprite from Final Fantasy VI serves as his first alternate outfit.
